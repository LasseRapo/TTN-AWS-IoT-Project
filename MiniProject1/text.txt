1. Sensing Layer Efficiency:

Our project utilizes HTS221 sensor for humidity and temperature data collecting, LPS22HB sensor for pressure data collecting
and we also simulated air quality data collecting using random value generator. 
The projects sensing layer appears to be efficient in terms of capturing environmental data using the different sensors, and 
the efficiency of this layer depends on the accuracy and reliability of those sensors and the data produced by them.
The efficiency can be affected by precision, calibration, and environmental conditions of the sensors.

2. Networking Layer Efficiency:
